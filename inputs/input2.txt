My experience at the Trial Hotel had its highs and lows. On one hand, the staff were exceptionally friendly and the room was comfortable, offering a good night's sleep. The location is also commendable, providing easy access to various tourist spots. However, there were areas that could use improvement. The Wi-Fi connectivity was inconsistent, which was inconvenient for both leisure and business activities. Additionally, while the food quality was good, the dining options were somewhat limited for guests with dietary restrictions. I believe addressing these issues could significantly enhance the overall guest experience.
