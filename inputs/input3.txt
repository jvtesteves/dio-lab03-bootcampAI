Unfortunately, my stay at the Trial Hotel was far from satisfactory. While I had high hopes based on its reputation, the reality did not meet expectations. The room was not well-maintained, with noticeable dust and a lingering musty odor. The noise levels from both the hallway and outside were disruptive throughout the night. Furthermore, the customer service was lacking; requests were either responded to very slowly or ignored altogether. The facilities also left much to be desired, with several amenities out of order. Overall, my experience was disappointing, and I would be hesitant to recommend this hotel to others.
